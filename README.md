# Stock-Market-Predic


Project Title: Stock Market Prediction Web Application

Description:

X: Developed an exclusive web application to predict stock market trends, focusing on high-accuracy predictions for key stocks.
Y: Leveraged a variety of machine learning and deep learning tools to build and optimize predictive models:
TensorFlow and Keras for building and training LSTM networks, capturing temporal patterns in stock prices.
scikit-learn for model evaluation and hyperparameter tuning, enhancing model performance.
Pandas for data manipulation and preprocessing of over 10 years of historical stock data (2010-2023).
Numpy for efficient numerical computations and array operations.
Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization, enabling in-depth analysis and presentation of stock trends.
Flask to develop and deploy the web application, facilitating real-time predictions for users.
Jupyter Notebook as the development environment for iterative model building and experimentation.
Z: The model accurately predicted Googleâ€™s stock opening price within a $0.19 margin of error (predicted: $163.34, actual: $163.15). Achieved an average prediction accuracy of 92%, outperforming baseline models by 15%. The application is currently used by 25 exclusive customers in an invite-only program, processing over 100 predictions per month.
Key Achievements:

Optimized model performance, reducing mean absolute error by 12% using hyperparameter tuning in scikit-learn.
Deployed the web application on AWS, ensuring 99.9% uptime and the capability to handle up to 200 predictions monthly.
Successfully maintained an exclusive client base, leading to high engagement and consistent user satisfaction.
